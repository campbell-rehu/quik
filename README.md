**Note: this app is still WIP**

This app is an online multiplayer version of [Tapple](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129556/tapple) or [Pim pam pet](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19408/series-pim-pam-pet).

This app was built using `create-react-app` for the front-end and using the Pluralsight tutorial code from [this repo](https://github.com/ManZzup/plguides/tree/master/11-using-websockets-in-your-react-redux-app)

The app has a front-end and back-end â€” both of which need to be running to play the game.

## Installing the dependencies

Run the following command from the project root directory AND from the `server`directory:

```bash
npm install
```

## Starting the front-end

Run the following command from the project root directory:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Starting the back-end

Run the following command from the `server` directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```
